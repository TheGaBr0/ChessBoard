# ChessBoard
A chess board for playing local games between 2 players. It also allows you to rewatch your matches. 


This project is entirely made with c. It's just a university project I have coded for fun. It may contains BUGS, don't complain about them :D.

En passant hasn't been implemented.

Works well on windows 10 and 11, never tried on any other OS.
